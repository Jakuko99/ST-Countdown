By right clicking on the main photo, popup menu will appear. There you can find options for this program.

In the program is one hidden picture. Hint: you must use your right mouse button to find it.

Backgrounds are fully customizable, just save your pictures in .jpg format and give them names starting from 1. When program couldn't find next file to load, it will load first one.
In the Slideshow settings you can change duration of the picture and also set repeat mode for slideshow and theme playback.
